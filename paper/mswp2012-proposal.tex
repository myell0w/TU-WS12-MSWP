\section{Synopsis}
\label{sect:synopsis}

% \note{
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item {\em Length: 1-2 pages}
%	\item Concise presentation of the scientific proposal, with particular attention to the ground-breaking nature of the research project, which will allow to assess the feasibility of the outlined scientific approach. 
%	\item WHY would you like to do WHAT, HOW would you like to do it and what are the expected RESULTS?
%	\item Short description of project idea.
%	\item Short description of problem / situation.
%	\item What makes it an interesting endeavor?
%	\item Why should somebody care?
%	\item Very short cost-benefit description (what are potential benefits that make them worth the costs of the project?).
%	\item Who are the beneficiaries of the results?
%	\item Problem classification (to which scientific area does the project belong?; is it basic or applied research?)
%	\item Constraints
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item     The project must have an extent that demands to handle it as a project including project organization.  (No 2 person pieces; no 150 person-year efforts)
%		\item     Software development should be part of the project. (But not its only content or scientific contribution.)
%		\item     The project should be interesting and meaningful.
%		\item     {\em Your creativity is called for!!}
%	\end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}

The goal of the project is to create and publish an e-health platform. This platform is based on a bonus/malus system for the users. So the users are able to find out how healthy they life. \\

The project is split into different phases. This enables a useable product after a short time but the vision is a long-term development. For each phase it is necessary to find different partner in economy and politics. The partners use the platform for advertisement and for costumer relationship. So the partners have benefits too. \\


Possible Partners are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Phase 1:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Supermarkets
			\item Fitness-Centers
			\item Restaurants
		\end{itemize}
	\item Phase 2 - $"$Embedding to existing services$"$:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Sport-Community with Tracking (Runtastic, RunKeeper, etc.)
			\item other Sporttracking-Services (Pedometer, etc.)
		\end{itemize}
	\item Phase 3 - $"$Health Organisations$"$:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Insurances 
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

When a user buys something in a shop of a partner he can register the products within an App. In the System the consummations get anonymised saved and analyzed based on a transparent score-schema. \\

The user can exchange the scores for gifts like coupons for healthy shopping by a partner. Moreover the platform can be used for rankings (which of the user live most healthy?) and lotteries. The partner can interact with the user over the platform. So they can advertise new promotions. This promotion can be used by the user for getting additional scores. \\


The goals of the platform:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Health of the User}: The peoples are getting more sensible for health-care. So they are going to live in a healthier way. The healthcare-system is very expansive. So the whole government will have a benefit from this platform and more healthier people. 
\item \textbf{Advertisment for the Partner}: For the partner the platform offers a chance to advertise their promotions. Furthermore they have the chance to spend coupons to the user. With this coupon they can interact with the costumer. So the customer loyalty is getting gain. The costumer is getting animated to buy more by partners. For this the partner has to refinance a part of the platform. 
\item \textbf{Benefits for User}: The User should get cheaper prices, when they buy some healthy things within partner stores. For example the coupons from an lottery in this platform.

\item An Excel template is provided as supplementary material to support budgeting.
\item Personnel costs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item     Justification for the personnel to be assigned to the project (type of position(s), description of nature of work, length and extent of involvement in the project)
	\item     The application should include all persons who will be required for the proposed project (project lead, researchers, developers, advisory board, etc.). The available legal categories of employment are contracts of employment for full- or part-time employees (DV) and reimbursement for work on an hourly basis (GB). In addition, a part-time contract of employment (DV 50\%, ``studentische Mitarbeiter'') may be requested for people who have not yet completed a Master or Diploma program (Diplom) in the relevant subject.
	 \item    The justification of the requested personnel should contain:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item 	        description of type of work;
		\item 		        extent of involvement (part-time contracts are permitted).
		\end{itemize}
	\item Exact numbers of employment categories can be found on the FWF Website (\href{http://www.fwf.ac.at/de/projects/personalkostensaetze.html}{http://www.fwf.ac.at/de/projects/personalkostensaetze.html})
	\end{itemize}
\item Equipment costs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item     Indicate reasons for equipment costs. The ``scientific equipment'' category includes instruments, system components, costs for the use of software required by the project and other durable goods provided the cost per item (including VAT) exceeds EUR 1,500.00.
	\end{itemize}
\item Material costs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item     This category encompasses consumables and smaller pieces of equipment where the cost per item is below EUR 1,500.00 including VAT. The calculation of requested material costs should be justified with reference to the schedule, work plan and experimental plan. Experience with previous projects should be taken into account.
	\end{itemize}
\item Travel costs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item     Funding may be requested for the costs of project-specific travel and accommodation, field work, expeditions, etc. Applicants are to provide a detailed travel (cost) plan broken down by project participant. For brief stays, the calculation of the travel and accommodation costs should be based on the federal regulations governing travel costs (RGV). The RGV rates governing Austria and abroad may be found in the FAQs on the FWF Website (\href{http://www.fwf.ac.at/de/faq/reisegebuehrenvorschrift.html}{http://www.fwf.ac.at/de/faq/reisegebuehrenvorschrift.html}). For longer stays an appropriate and comprehensible cost plan should be prepared.
	\end{itemize}
\item Other costs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item     Independent contracts for work and services (costs for work of clearly defined scope and content assigned to individuals, provided that this is scientifically justifiable and economical)
    	\item     Costs that cannot be included under personnel, equipment, material or travel costs, such as:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item         reimbursement of costs towards or for the use of research facilities, e.g. of large-scale research facilities (project-specific 'equipment time'). Applicants should obtain and submit multiple offers;
		\item         costs for project-specific work carried out outside the applicant's research institution (e.g. for analysis work performed elsewhere, for interviews, for sample collection, for preparation of thin slices etc.). Applicants should obtain and submit multiple offers;
		\item         honoraria for test persons;
		\end{itemize}
